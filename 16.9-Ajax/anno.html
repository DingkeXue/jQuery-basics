<div>Here we address the issues of low emission yield and chem-ical instability of NC matrices through the use of ligand-free encapsulation of colloidal nanocrystals within an all-inorganic crystalline solid. The present technique builds upon a recently reported semiconductor matrix embedded nanocrystal array (SMENA) approach</div>
